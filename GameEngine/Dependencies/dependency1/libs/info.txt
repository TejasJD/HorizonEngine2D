A libs folder containing the .lib and .dll files.

Add this folder to Library Directories:
Right click project -> Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Library Directories -> Edit -> New Line (Hover over buttons to see tooltip) -> Paste the following: $(SolutionDir)Dependencies\dependency1\libs 

Note: If this folder is not called libs, then you should also change the "libs" part in the path above.

Add the library (.lib file) to:
Right click project -> Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependecies -> Edit -> <dependency_name>.lib

Note: Make sure you are in the correct configuration, otherwise you will get linking errors! (Right click project -> Properties -> Make sure Configuration (top-left corner) is set to "Debug"/"Active(Debug)" while developing.)
